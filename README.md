# Quotes Collection
A simple app that allows to add quotes and names to a database and display them on a separate page.

- The 'add my quote' button adds the quote to the database.
- The 'skip to quotes' button takes the user directly to the main page.  

URLs for this app:
- GET ' / ' for index.
- POST '/quotes' for the method of the form to make a new quote.
- GET '/quotes' for the screen on the right (where all the quotes are rendered).
